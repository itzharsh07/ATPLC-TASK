      Darbhanga, a historic city in the northern part of Bihar, India, is often referred to as the cultural capital of the state. Known for its royal lineage and deep-rooted Maithili culture, the city boasts an impressive legacy of art, music, and education.

      The city is home to the Darbhanga Raj, one of the richest and most influential zamindari estates during British rule. Darbhanga Palace and other architectural marvels still stand as a testament to its regal past. The region is also famous for its contributions to Indian classical music, particularly through the Darbhanga gharana of dhrupad.
